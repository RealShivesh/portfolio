            I am currently a final year undergraduate student studying in BITS
            Pilani Goa Campus. <br />
            I am a front end web developer with a keen awareness about the web
            development as well as UI/UX desgning.
            <br />I possess different passions and interests, including watching
            football, learning languages, writing poetry, pushing my body to the
            limits by working out and learning more about psychology.
